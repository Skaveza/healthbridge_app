# HealthBridge App API

**HealthBridge** ranks nearby health facilities based on a user's health needs and location.  
The API is built using **Flask** and documented with **Flasgger** (Swagger UI).

---

## Features

- Loads health facility data from a JSON file  
- Accepts user’s health need and location as input  
- Returns a ranked list of facilities based on:
  - Match score
  - Safety rating
  - Distance from the user

  {
    "facility_name": "Hope Medical Center",
    "match_score": 0.93,
    "distance_km": 2.5,
    "safety_rating": "High",
    "location": {

    }
  }

 Supported Health Needs
Available values for need_value include:

pediatrics

cardiology

emergency

general

(See health_needs.py for the full list of supported categories.)

 Ranking Criteria
Facilities are ranked using a combination of:

Match score (how well the facility meets the health need)

Distance (from user location)

Safety rating (predefined or scored from data)

Note: The algorithm currently gives equal weight to each of these factors. This can be customized in future versions.

 API Response Codes
200: Success — returns a ranked list of facilities

400: Bad Request — missing or invalid input fields

404: No matching facilities found for the given criteria

 Validation Rules
lat and lng must be valid geographic coordinates

need_value must match one of the supported health need categories

Both fields are required in the request

 Data Requirements
The file facilities.json must be placed in the project root directory.

    "facility_name": "Hope Medical Center",

🛠 Troubleshooting
Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible via python3

If venv creation fails, install it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
If Flask doesn't start, check for firewall or port conflicts

 Notes
Update the repository URL in this README if you move or fork the project

Make sure health_needs.py and facilities.json are correctly configured
