# HealthBridge App API

**HealthBridge** ranks nearby health facilities based on a user's health needs and location.  
The API is built using **Flask** and documented with **Flasgger** (Swagger UI).

---

## Features

- Loads health facility data from a JSON file  
- Accepts user‚Äôs health need and location as input  
- Returns a ranked list of facilities based on:
  - Match score
  - Safety rating
  - Distance from the user

 Supported Health Needs
Available values for need_value include:

pediatrics

cardiology

emergency

general

(See health_needs.py for the full list of supported categories.)

 Ranking Criteria
Facilities are ranked using a combination of:

Match score (how well the facility meets the health need)

Distance (from user location)

Safety rating (predefined or scored from data)

Note: The algorithm currently gives equal weight to each of these factors. This can be customized in future versions.

 API Response Codes
200: Success ‚Äî returns a ranked list of facilities

400: Bad Request ‚Äî missing or invalid input fields

404: No matching facilities found for the given criteria

 Validation Rules
lat and lng must be valid geographic coordinates

need_value must match one of the supported health need categories

Both fields are required in the request

 Data Requirements
The file facilities.json must be placed in the project root directory.

üõ† Troubleshooting
Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible via python3

If venv creation fails, install it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
If Flask doesn't start, check for firewall or port conflicts

 Notes
Update the repository URL in this README if you move or fork the project

Make sure health_needs.py and facilities.json are correctly configured
